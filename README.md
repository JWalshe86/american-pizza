# AMERICAN PIZZA - ORDER SYSTEM
## OVERVIEW
I created a fully functional order system for a fictional restaurant called American Pizza, whose field of activity is the preparation and serving of pizza inspired by american fast-food. The main purpose of this program is to facilitate the process of taking orders by introducing a system that automatically populate a google spreadsheet with data about each order for a better monitoring. Also it is very useful for the restaurant's clients because it estimates the waiting time for each order and it gives them the option to check their order status live.
American Pizza order system was created entirely with Python and cand be used through the terminal implemented with the Code Institute Python Template whose design was adapted to respect the restaurant theme.
